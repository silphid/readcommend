# Dev scripts and tools

- Bash scripts for development-time.
- [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) is a variant of the main `docker-compose.yml` that only starts the psql database for development, assuming the go server will be built and run by developer.
- [seed.xlsx](seed.xlsx) is the dataset that I put together from some public dataset and then cleaned-up and augmented with required dummy data and relations.
